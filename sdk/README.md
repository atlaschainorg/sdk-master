# Atlas SDK

Use the Atlas SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Atlas Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/atlas-program) instead.

More information about Atlas is available in the [Atlas documentation](https://atlaschain.org/docs).

The [Atlas Program Library](https://github.com/atlaschainorg/atlas-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
