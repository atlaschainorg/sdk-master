# Atlas SDK WASM JS

Use the Atlas SDK WASM JS crate to build a JS package with `wasm-pack` usable in Node or browser environments.
See the [Atlas Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/atlas-program) instead for on-chain programs, and, the [Atlas SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/atlas-sdk) for client-side
applications.

More information about Atlas is available in the [Atlas documentation](https://atlaschain.org/docs).
