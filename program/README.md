# Atlas Program

Use the Atlas Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Atlas SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/atlas-sdk) instead.

More information about Atlas is available in the [Atlas documentation](https://atlaschain.org/docs).

[Atlas Program Library](https://github.com/atlas-labs/atlas-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
